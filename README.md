# Sugarcane_Production_Project
A simple Exploratory Data Analysis of Sugarcane Production 

Here, I have done EDA on Sugarcane Production which involves data cleaning, data visualization(Univariate and bivariate analysis) and using which I uncover interesting insights on sugarcane production of various countries and continents.

Features of the Project:

Comprehensive Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicate entries and inconsistent data types.
Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to represent sugarcane production trends and patterns.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed relationships between different variables affecting production.

Tools and Libraries:

Python: The programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations.

Key Insights:

Regional Trends: Observed which regions contribute the most to sugarcane production.
Seasonal Patterns: Identified how production varies across different seasons.
Correlation Analysis: Highlighted significant factors affecting production.
